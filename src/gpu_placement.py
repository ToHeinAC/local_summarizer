"""Which GPU a locally-loaded Ollama model should sit on. Plain python, no LangChain.

Default policy: keep a model on **one** card whenever it fits. Splitting layers
across cards does not make single-stream decoding faster — the GPUs run
sequentially, each idling while the other works, and every token pays a
cross-device hop. A split buys capacity, not speed, so it is worth taking only
when one card cannot hold the model.

Measured on this box (2x RTX 4090) with the sibling
`local-llm-testing <https://github.com/ToHeinAC/local-llm-testing>`_ bench
harness: gemma-4-E4B 94 -> 170 tok/s and Ollama 149 -> 164 tok/s once pinned
instead of split. See ``docs/gpu.md``.

Two traps, each one a debugging round-trip:

1. **`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` alone silently fails for Ollama.** It offers every
   card through CUDA *and* Vulkan, so a card hidden from CUDA reappears as a
   Vulkan device and the model loads there anyway — asking for GPU 1 lands you
   on GPU 0. `OLLAMA_VULKAN=0` (set by ``ollama_server``) makes the CUDA filter
   authoritative.
2. **CUDA orders devices fastest-first, not by PCI bus.** Without
   `CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID`, index N here need not be nvidia-smi's GPU N.
   `cuda_env()` always sets both, and never one without the other.

OPTIONAL AND GRACEFUL: no nvidia-smi, a single card, or a model too big for one
card all yield an unpinned `Placement` and the runtime places the model exactly
as it does today.
